# Nodejs basics - 


### What is Nodejs ?
  * 
  * ***Summary - nodejs is JS on server, it is possible becoz nodejs uses V8 JS on the server to run all the JS code that we provide.
  Nodejs is able to teach JS new things by providing C++ bindings to V8, this allows JS to do anything that C++ can do like accessing Filesystem etc..***
